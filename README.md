# StarWars
This project is for learning and practicing Javascript concepts using the Star Wars API. The end goal is to have every resource available in a clean card-type format.

Currently, the application is able to get all of the planets and create list elements to display the planet names.

Here is a screenshot of the current status of the application, with more updates planned soon:
